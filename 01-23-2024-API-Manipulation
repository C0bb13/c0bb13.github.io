In this [project](/assets/MastodonBots.ipynb){:target="_blank"}, I demonstrate the ability to access and manipulate website APIs by creating and deploying botted accounts to the social media site Mastodon, which can be used within the Python client to respond to any account using language modeling to customize your desired response.

This can be tested by creating a Mastodon account at the link provided and responding to that account using any of my bots.

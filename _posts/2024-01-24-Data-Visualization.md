In this [project](/assets/PortfolioDataViz.ipynb){:target="_blank"}, I demonstrate my data visualization skills by parsing large datasets and displaying data using Python packages such as matplotlib and altair.

These include selections based on a wide variety of data, such as GIS mapping, longitudinal Covid-19 information, and international vehicle specifications. By introducing interable elements to my charts I aim to create a helpful interface for exploring deeper trends within the data and allow the user to find the informaiton they need within their own specifications.

Here are some HTML-friendly selections of interactable charts that I created:

<iframe src="/assets/CarSelector.html" Height = "500" Width = "500" ></iframe>
Click and drag to create a selection within the graph.

<iframe src="/assets/WeatherChart.html" Height = "475" Width = "730" ></iframe>
Click and drag to examine the average minimum temperature within a specific time frame.

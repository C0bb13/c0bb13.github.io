In this [project](/assets/PortfolioDataViz.ipynb){:target="_blank"}, I demonstrate my data visualization skills by parsing large datasets and displaying data using Python packages such as matplotlib and altair.

These include an interactive graph of recent international Covid-19 statistics, an interactive graph of a large database of automobile safety information, and a zoomable map of the state of Texas according to Covid-19 death statistics. 

Here are some HTML-friendly selections of interactable charts:

<iframe src="/assets/CarSelector.html" Height = "500" Width = "500" ></iframe>
Click and drag to create a selection within the graph.
<iframe src="/assets/WeatherChart.html" Height = "465" Width = "750" ></iframe>
Click and drag to examine the average minimum temperature within a specific time frame.
<iframe src="/assets/CovidChart.html" Height = "465" Width = "750" ></iframe>
Examine individual nations' Covid-19 deaths over time in 2021 by clicking their bar charts. Click the background of the bar chart to go back to the full line chart.

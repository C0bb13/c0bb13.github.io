In this [project](/assets/PortfolioDataViz.ipynb){:target="_blank"}, I demonstrate my data visualization skills by parsing large datasets and displaying data using Python packages such as matplotlib and altair.

These include an interactive graph of recent international Covid-19 statistics, an interactive graph of a large database of automobile safety information, and a zoomable map of the state of Texas according to Covid-19 death statistics.

In this [project](/assets/RPortfolioAnalysis){:target="_blank"}, I examine a dataset of laborforce activity, evaluating the relationship between female labor force participation rate and the divorce rate by developing and finetuning multivariate regression models. I use a train-test data split to reduce noise and examine outlier datapoints to arrive at an optimal regression model for examining my hypothesis.

title: "Master's thesis | Loneliness in America: A Sociological Approach"
categories: media

In my [masterâ€™s thesis](http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:hulib-202009024006), I investigate the existing scientific literature on loneliness and social isolation and examine the conceptual differences between the two. I argue that while theoretically similar, differences in empirical studies and divergences in population data strongly support a clear distinction between the two in future research, something which sadly has been lacking in much of the previous research on the topic.

In examining previous literature I outline the features of loneliness within the American population, including many surprising findings which challenge popular notions of who experiences loneliness and when. Young people experience the most loneliness, part of a broader mental health crisis afflicting America's youth. While social media is often blamed for this mental health crisis, I outline research on the topic which challenges these cliched notions, suggesting that the relationship between social media use and loneliness is much more complicated than is commonly assumed.

I also explore some of the many ways in which Sociological theory contributes to our understanding of loneliness, including a discussion of social network analysis, which demonstrates that loneliness functions as a social contagion which spreads from person to person and spreads more when in closer physical proximity. Sociological theory also aids in the development of interventions to reduce loneliness. In my paper I examine different pathways to accomplish this, including living arrangements, legislation, public health initiatives, and more.

I am a recent graduate of the University of Texas at Dallas, where I received my Master's degree in Applied Sociology. I am specialized in quantitative methods and data analytics, with experience in R, Python, Stata, machine learning, and multiple regression. I take pride in my ability to identify patterns within data generating processes and in their presentation. My background in the social sciences has equipped me with an enhanced understanding of population dynamics, public health, and the importance of a diverse and inclusive approach to scientific inquiry.
